# Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems
### Instituto Superior Técnico
Project from the course of Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems

## Introduction
The goal of the project is to create a Highly Dependable Notary application (HDS
Notary). The main goal of the HDS Notary is to certify the transfer of ownership of
arbitrary goods between users. HDS Notary has a set of dependability guarantees.

## Project Description
We propose as our project, in the context of AAMAS, a system of smart elevators, where the elevators are the agents in a multi-agent system with focus on the communication between the agents to improve the efficiency of the system and some experience based learning. With the implementation of our project, we expect to achieve an improvement in reducing the wait time for the users of this system, since that in tall buildings, at some times of the day, the affluence of the elevators largely increases, and we believe we can mitigate this by teaching the elevators where is most efficient to be at each time of the day and by making the elevators efficiently communicate in order to send the one elevator that believes is going to make the route faster.
